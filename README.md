# Shopping Cart Take Home

Built with `vite` using the `vanilla` template, I created components as dom nodes from interpolated strings and added them to the dom. Because we're using vanilla js, I placed listeners on all buttons for every product card. I ran out of time at the 2-hour mark and there is some refinement that is needed with regards to cart totals and coupon application.
